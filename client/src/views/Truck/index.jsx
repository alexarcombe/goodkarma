            This boxy shaped truck was manufactured back in 1995. We imported it
            from Japan, (which was a nightmare) but long story short, it landed
            in New Zealand in November 2016. And it was love at first sight.

            During 2017 we've been fitting it out and by the end of the year the
            truck was ready to hit the road.

            Since then, it's been a hell of a ride going to markets, festivals,
            functions, meeting unforgettable people and going to amazing places.
